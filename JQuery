Jquery is library of Javascript , it's very popular with lots of functions
Here is the learning notes which I take.
(leave out the steps to bulid the product enviroment)...

The first is How to use Jquery selector :
  1. $("#id")
  2. $(".class")
  3. $("element")
  4. $("element/id/class").parent()
  5. $("element/id/class").child();
  6. $(":element/id/class")
  7. $(":nth-child(n)")
  
Then we should know how to add function , here is the remarkable function I use :
   animated bounce hinge / clone() appendTo()
   How to add?
   ex:
      $("#id").addClass("animated bounce");(there are have two functions)
      $(".class").parent().addClass("hinge");
      
some JavaScript operations:
  1： .push()--takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
  2:  .pop() --is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable.
  3： .shift()-- it works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.
  4:  .unshift()-- works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.
